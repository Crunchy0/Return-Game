My first attempt to create something resembling a videogame on my own.

I implemented inventory, tinkered with Unity NavMesh and created a couple of weapons along with the basic health mechanic.
As for the AI implementation, it's not only about NavMesh API - agents are operated by custom behaviour trees.
There are even rudiments of ladder climbing mechanic, but it's broken at the current state of the project.

There is practically no visuals in this game now and the development is frozen.
But me getting back to working on or re-creating this game in the future is quite possible :)
